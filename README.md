## I. Abstract of the Project
<p align="justify"> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project offers an in-depth analysis of an <b>RRP</b> variant <b>SCARA</b> Manipulator, <b><i>Selective Compliance Articulated Robot for Assembly</i></b>. This includes the calculation of the degrees of freedom (DOF).  The use of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) frame notation, which offers a methodical representation of the interaction between links and joints, is also explored in this section for modeling the kinematics of the SCARA Manipulator. The inverse kinematics will also be presented in this project. Furthermore, the GUI calculator gives assistance in terms of checking if the calculations of various parts of the SCARA manipulator are correct. All the fundamental concepts that have been mentioned were supported through simulation in Python, whereas it can be utilized to operate a wide range of services and programs. Images and additional descriptions are also added to create a more defined illustration of the principles of how a SCARA Manipulator operates.</p>

## II. Introduction of the Project
<p align="justify"> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1978, Professor Hiroshi Makino's group at Yamanashi University in Japan created the first **SCARA** <b><i>(Selective Compliance Articulated Robot for Assembly)</i></b> manipulator for use in industry. The initial purpose of SCARA robots was to meet the demand for quick and accurate assembly activities in the manufacturing sector. For a variety of assembly processes, including pick-and-place, assembly, and packaging applications, its mobility is helpful. SCARA robots, which were initially introduced to industrial assembly lines in 1981, continue to provide the finest results for high-speed assembly. The desire to combine the advantages of Cartesian and Articulated robots, allowing for increased reach, flexibility, and precision in assembly tasks, had an impact on the development of SCARA manipulators.
  <p align="justify"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As technology undergoes rapid advancement, complicated tasks such as control systems are accomplished with a highly automated control system. Due to increased use of industrial robot arms, an evolution to that topic began trying to imitate human movements in a detailed mode. The mechanical design of the robot arm is based on a robot manipulator with similar functions to a human arm. The links of such a manipulator are connected by joints allowing rotational motion and the links of the manipulator are considered to form a kinematic chain. The business end of the kinematic chain of the manipulator is called the end effector or end-of-arm-tooling and it is analogous to the human hand. To validate the right positioning of the robotic arm, inverse kinematics calculations are carried out.

## III. Degrees of Freedom of SCARA Mechanical Manipulaltor
<p align="justify"> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>DOF, or Degrees of Freedom</b>, refers to the number of possible independent variables or parameters that a system or a manipulator can possess. Moreover, it is usually referred to as the number of joints or axes of motion. In a mechanism, three-dimensional space can support up to 6 degrees of freedom, represented as translational and rotational. Whereas, translational motion refers to the movement that is both linear and non-rotational. While rotational motion is referred to as the opposite of translational motion. The SCARA manipulator has a total of 3 degrees of freedom, and it consists of 2 revolute joints and 1 prismatic joint, also referred to as RRP (Revolute-Revolute-Prismatic).
