## I. Abstract of the Project
<p align="justify"> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project offers an in-depth analysis of an <b>RRP</b> variant <b>SCARA</b> Manipulator, <b><i>Selective Compliance Articulated Robot for Assembly</i></b>. This includes the calculation of the degrees of freedom (DOF).  The use of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) frame notation, which offers a methodical representation of the interaction between links and joints, is also explored in this section for modeling the kinematics of the SCARA Manipulator. The inverse kinematics will also be presented in this project. Furthermore, the GUI calculator gives assistance in terms of checking if the calculations of various parts of the SCARA manipulator are correct. All the fundamental concepts that have been mentioned were supported through simulation in Python, whereas it can be utilized to operate a wide range of services and programs. Images and additional descriptions are also added to create a more defined illustration of the principles of how a SCARA Manipulator operates.</p>
